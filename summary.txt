Project Name: Friend Recommendations (Gardening Club)


Overview:
* The project aims to provide friend recommendations based on shared interests and/or common friends.
* We'll use the concept of a gardening club as our example, where members have varied interests within gardening, such as their favourite tools.
* Users input their weightings for each interest and then receive recommendations based on their preferences.
* Our project works in a way that any sort of interests can be used! Our creativity feature is gardening club, but it can be done for absolutely anything.


Functionality:
* File Reading: Reads two files: 'interests.csv' and 'friendships.csv' to extract information.
* User Interaction: Users are prompted to choose between finding the degree of connection between two people or receiving friend recommendations
* Interest-based Recommendations:
   1. Allows users to specify their interests and weightings.
   2. Generates recommendations based on shared interests.
* Compatibility: Works with any properly formatted 'interests.csv' file.


Concepts Used:
1. Graph and Graph Algorithms 
   1. Implements Breadth First Search (BFS) to find the degree of recommendation between two individuals when prompted.
   2. Representing existing friendships as an Adjacency Matrix.
2. Social Network
   1.  Implements triadic, focal, and membership closures for friend recommendations.
3. Document Search
   1. Extracting data from the csv files for friendships and interests.
